## Overview ##

---


A sign language is a language which, instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns,uses visually transmitted sign patterns to fluidly express a speaker's thoughts. With recent advances in Computer Vision , Sign Language Recognition offers great potential as a unique form of interaction between computer and a human user. This project is an effort to build an assistive tool  to make computers more accessible to people.

## Usability ##

---


  * Visually Impaired can use sign language to operate their machines using sign based commands as a keyboard/input replacement.
  * Speech impaired people can use to communicate by adding a Text to Speech Feature to communicate  over VOIP.
  * Elderly people for convenience.

## Challenges Faced ##

---

  * Hardware/ Software Compatibility Issues
  * Illuminance Changes in real-time stream input.
  * 2-D transformations/calculation on inherently 3-D objects.
  * Non availability of robust open source implementation of ML Techniques.
  * Gesture Recognition in real-time is hard !!

## Future Work ##

---


  * All type of gesture recognition, esp, moving gestures. - Difficult
  * Combinations of Facial & Hand Expressions. – Moderately Difficult.
  * Our system in current form can be adapted to it, with appropriate dataset.
  * Using sign language as shortcuts to various applications & functionality. – Very Easy!
  * Integrate with Mobile Devices to help disabled to communicate in normal/emergency    situations. – Easy but very relevant.
